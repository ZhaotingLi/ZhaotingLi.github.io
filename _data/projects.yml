  description: >
    * Proposed a learning-based force filtering method that utilizes the filtered-and-amplified robot-side forces as the ground truth, to reduce the noise introduced by the trotting action.
    
    * Designed an efficient transformer-based neural network,collected data during the collaboration between humans and ANYMal with an arm, and trained the network in the typical supervised learning framework.
    
    * Tested the effectiveness of the proposed force filtering method with the admittance control framework.

  name: 'Learning Robot Exploration Strategy with Deep Reinforcement Learning'
  description: >
    * Proposed 4D point-clouds-like information, which consists of 2D points’ location information, and the corresponding 1D frontier and 1D distance information.
    
    * Designed the corresponding training framework based on the deep Q-Learning method and modified it to adapt to the variable action space.
    
    * Demonstrated the performance of the proposed method on a wide variety of environments, which the model has not seen before, and includes maps whose size is much larger than maps in the training set.

  name: 'Efficient Heuristic Generation for Robot Path Planning'
  description: >
    * Designed a novel recurrent generative model to generate efficient heuristic for robot path planning.

    * Incrementally constructed the heuristic through the feedback of historical information.

    * Combinedthe generated heuristic with RRT* algorithm to guide the algorithm to find both initial and optimal solutions in a faster and more efficient way.
