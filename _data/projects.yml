    * Proposed a learning-based force filtering method that utilizes the filtered-and-amplified robot-side forces as the ground truth, to reduce the noise introduced by the trotting action.
    
    * Designed an efficient transformer-based neural network,collected data during the collaboration between humans and ANYMal with an arm, and trained the network in the typical supervised learning framework.
    
    * Tested the effectiveness of the proposed force filtering method with the admittance control framework.

  description: >
    * Proposed 4D point-clouds-like information, which consists of 2D points’ location information, and the corresponding 1D frontier and 1D distance information.
    
    * Designed the corresponding training framework based on the deep Q-Learning method and modified it to adapt to the variable action space.
    
    * Demonstrated the performance of the proposed method on a wide variety of environments, which the model has not seen before, and includes maps whose size is much larger than maps in the training set.
