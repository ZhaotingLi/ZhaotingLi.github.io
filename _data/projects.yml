  name: 'Learning Muti-Robot Exploration Strategy with Adaptive-QMIX algorithm'
  description: >
    For cooperative muti-agent reinforcement learning problems, centralized training and decentralized execution algorithms are 
    proposed to utilize the global information during training and to extract margnial policies for execution. In this project,
    we want to find out and imporve the performance of such algorithm in a more realistic task: the multi-robot explorations where 
    the robots work as a term to explore an unknown map at minimum cost.

  description: >
    In this project, I trained a neural nework based on three types of muti-task learning framework. Besides comparing the effects of different hyperparameters
    and structures, I proposed an adaptive weight tuning method which can dynamically adjust the weight of each task's loss during train.

  name: 'Learning Robot Exploration Strategy with Deep Reinforcement Learning'
  description: >
    Being able to explore unknown environments is a requirement for fully autonomous robots.
    Many learning-based methods have been proposed to learn an exploration strategy. 
    In the frontier-based exploration, learning algorithms tend to learn the optimal or near-optimal frontier to explore. 
    Most of these methods represent the environments as fixed size images and take these as inputs to neural networks. 
    However, the size of environments is usually unknown, which makes these methods fail to generalize to real world scenarios.
    To address this issue, we present a novel state representation method based on 4D point-clouds-like information, including the locations, frontier, and distance information.
    We also design a neural network that can process these 4D point-clouds-like information and generate the estimated value for each frontier.
    Then this neural network is trained using the typical reinforcement learning framework.

  name: 'Efficient Heuristic Generation for Robot Path Planning'
  description: >
    Robot path planning is difficult to solve due to the contradiction between the optimality of results and the complexity of algorithms, even in 2D environments. 
    To find an optimal path, the algorithm needs to search all the state space, which costs many computation resources. 
    To address this issue, we present a novel recurrent generative model (RGM), which generates efficient heuristic to reduce the search efforts of path planning algorithms.

    * Designed an automatic and low-cost robot scanning system consisting of a kinect camera, a UR 10 robot and a line laser scanner. Also calibrated the coordinate systems.
    * Proposed an online correction methods based on follow-up control and scanned data to optimize the pose of the laser scanner. 
    * Proposed a novel path planning methods for laser scanning based on the least square fitting and online correction. This path planning method has been validated in many use cases under various work conditions.
