intro:
  title: Hello!
  body: >
I am a second-year PhD candidate at the Department of Cognitive Robotics at TU Delft, where I work with [Prof. Jens Kober](http://www.jenskober.de/) and [Prof. Cosimo Della Santina](https://cosimodellasantina.eu/). My research focuses on robot learning, interactive imitation learning, and applying these techniques to real-world robotics problems, such as harvesting and performing everyday tasks.
