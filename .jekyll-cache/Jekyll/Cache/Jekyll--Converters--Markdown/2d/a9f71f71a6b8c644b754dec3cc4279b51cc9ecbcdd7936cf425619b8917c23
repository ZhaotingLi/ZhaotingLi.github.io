  <li>Proposed 4D point-clouds-like information, which consists of 2D pointsâ€™ location information, and the corresponding 1D frontierand 1D distance information.</li>
  <li>Designedthe corresponding training framework based on the deep Q-Learning method and modifiedit to adapt to variable action space.</li>
  <li>Demonstratedthe performance ofthe proposed method on a wide variety of environments, which the model has not seen before, and includes maps whose size is much larger than maps in the training set.</li>
