I"4<p>Sampling-based motion planning methods are widely adopted in autonomous driving. Typically, sampling can be decoupled into two  layers: a path sampling layer and a speed profile sampling layer. For the path sampling layer, traditional methods tend to  sample with a uniform distribution over the whole feasible space, which might cause either computational inefficiency or  poor performance if the sampling resolution is not set appropriately. To solve this problem, we propose an adaptive path  sampling approach that samples from a time-varying distribution depending on the dynamic environment and potential costs  of the ego vehicle. Such sampling strategy is then combined with a non-conservatively defensive strategy in the speed sampling  layer to generate a set of safe but not overcautious trajectories.</p>
