  <li>Applied the discrete elastic-band-based motion planning method(EB planner)to generate piecewise linear collision-free path with dynamic programming.</li>
  <li>Employed pure pursuit controller to smooth this path.â€¢Used a spatial and speed sampling methodtogether with acascaded ranking method to optimize the trajectory with many hierarchical features.</li>
  <li>Applied a non-conservatively defensive strategy to avoid overreacting to threats with low probability.</li>
  <li>Adaptively adjust sampling resolution based on the environment and the objectives oftheego vehicle.</li>
