<p>3D object detection is crucial for autonomous driving, where the most frequently used 3D sensor are the LiDAR sensors. 
The typical commonly-used 2-stage framework is composed of two networks: the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and the proposal refining network.
In this report, we propose several methods to improve the network performance:
(1) Include the local coordinate and intensity information as features.
(2) Using Adam as optimizer instead of SGD.
(3) Adding IoU loss for the regression task.
(4) Changing the bounding box enlargement strategy for roi pooling step.</p>
