  <li>Proposed a learning-based force filtering method that utilizes the filtered-and-amplified robot-side forces as the ground truth, to reduce the noise introduced by the trotting action.</li>
  <li>Designed an efficient transformer-based neural network,collected data during the collaboration between humans and ANYMal with an arm, and trained the network in the typical supervised learning framework.</li>
  <li>Tested the effectiveness of the proposed force filtering method with the admittance control framework.</li>
