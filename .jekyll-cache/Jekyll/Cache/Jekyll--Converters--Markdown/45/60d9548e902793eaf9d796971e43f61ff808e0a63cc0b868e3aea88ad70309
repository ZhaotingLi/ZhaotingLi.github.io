<p>Advisor: Prof. Dr. Stelian Coros, Computational Robotics Lab, ETH Zurich</p>

<p>Contact-rich tasks require the robot to make necessary contacts with the environment. 
One example is the stowing task at the Amazon factory, where elastic bands are mounted on the cabinet to prevent objects from falling out.
In this case, contacts with elastic bands are inevitable during package stowing.
For robot arms equipped with the torque-sensing capabilities, the contact detection algorithm can estimate the contact point location and contact force. 
Furthermore, the contact information can be utilized for estimating the model of the environment and for planning with safety constraints. 
The goal of this project is to explore ways to robustly detect external contacts, utilize contact information, and trajectory planning to enable smooth and safe contact-rich tasks.</p>
