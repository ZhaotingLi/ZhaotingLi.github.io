  <li>Designeda novel recurrent generative modelto generate efficientheuristic for robot path planning.
• Incrementally constructedthe heuristic through the feedback of historical information.
• Combinedthe generated heuristic with RRT* algorithm to guide the algorithm to find both initial and optimal solutions in a faster and more efficient way.</li>
