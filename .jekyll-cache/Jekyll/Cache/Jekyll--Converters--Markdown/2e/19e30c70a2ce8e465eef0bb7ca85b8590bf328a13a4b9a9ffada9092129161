  <li>Designed a novel recurrent generative model to generate efficient heuristic for robot path planning.</li>
  <li>Incrementally constructed the heuristic through the feedback of historical information.</li>
  <li>Combinedthe generated heuristic with RRT* algorithm to guide the algorithm to find both initial and optimal solutions in a faster and more efficient way.</li>
