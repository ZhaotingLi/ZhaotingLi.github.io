### A sampled-based trajectory planning method for urban autonomous vehicles
* Advisor: Masayoshi Tomizuka , IEEE Fellow and Professor of Mechanical Engineering, UC Berkeley


In this project, we designed a motion planning method for urban autonomous vehicles. This method have the advantages of fast sampling speed, time-bounded collison-free path generation and sampling-based decision making method.
